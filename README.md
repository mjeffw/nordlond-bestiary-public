Repository for public access of Nordlond Bestiary issues.

## Using the Bestiary
After installation into your Foundry instance, you access the bestiary by selecting the "Compendiums" tab in the sidebar on the right of the Foundry window. There should be an "Actor" compendium entitled "Nordlond Bestiary and Enemies".

Click on that compendium and a window will open inside Foundry with an alphabetically sorted list of all the bestiary entries.

From this window you can search for a specific entry using the search bar, or click on an entry to open its Actor sheet inside Foundry.

When you see an entry you would like to use in a game session, open its Actor sheet and click the "Import" button in its title bar. This will add the entry to your Actors Directory in the sidebar.

At this point, the new Actor is ready to be used in a session.
