## Using the Bestiary

After installation into your Foundry instance, you access the bestiary by selecting the "Compendiums" tab in the sidebar on the right of the Foundry window. There should be an "Actor" compendium entitled "Nordlond Bestiary and Enemies".

Click on that compendium and a window will open inside Foundry with an alphabetically sorted list of all the bestiary entries.

From this window you can search for a specific entry using the search bar, or click on an entry to open its Actor sheet inside Foundry.

When you see an entry you would like to use in a game session, open its Actor sheet and click the "Import" button in its title bar. This will add the entry to your Actors Directory in the sidebar.

At this point, the new Actor is ready to be used in a session.

## Overview of the Bestiary Actor Sheet

### Rollable Fields

Many of the fields on the actor sheet that could be rolled against in a game are clickable. Those fields are highlighted in gold when the mouse cursor hovers over them. In the example below, the mouse is hovering over the Augnarath's Strength (ST) score.

Clicking on these fields will make a standard GURPS 3d roll against that number, modified by any value in the modifier bucket.

### Modifiers

Some fields on the actor sheet will add bonuses or penalties to the modifier bucket. These are highlighted in orange. SM, or Size Modifier, is being hovered over.

### Editable Fields

Current HP, current FP, [Fantastic Dungeon Grappling](https://gaming-ballistic.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/fantastic-dungeon-grappling?_pos=5&_fid=532e29de0&_ss=c&variant=42552585322751) control points (CP), and Energy Reserve (if present) are editable. To change the currernt value, click into this field and replace its contents with the new current value.

### Attacks

Under the attributes is the Attacks section of the Actor sheet.

The name and level of the attack is rollable, as is the damage.

Modifiers like Acc and Bulk are also clickable and add their values to the modifier bucket.

### Skills and Spells

All skills and spells (if present) are rollable, as expected.

### Special Abilities and Notes

This section contains information that may be important in an encounter.

### Defenses

At the bottom of the Actor sheet, in a section that is always visible, are the various defense rolls typically made by this enemy. Parry, Dodge, and Block are clickable.

If one of those scores has an additional "+X" (+2, for example) to the right of the score, the actor has a Defensive Bonus (DB) equal to that value, typically from a shield. For defense rolls that qualify for the DB, click that field to make the corresponding defense roll with the DB modifier.

### Control Thresholds

This area tracks the current control threshold that applies to this actor, based on the current number of Control Points (CP) applied. This is a value from the [Fantastic Dungeon Grappling](https://gaming-ballistic.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/fantastic-dungeon-grappling?_pos=5&_fid=532e29de0&_ss=c&variant=42552585322751) rules and determines the DX penalty applied to the Actor.
