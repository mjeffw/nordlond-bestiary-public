# Norðlond Óvinabókin Bestiary and Enemies Book

This GitHub is for support of the [Foundry](https://foundryvtt.com) module, [**Norðlond Óvinabókin: Nordlond Bestiary and Enemies**](https://gaming-ballistic.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/nordlondr-ovinabokin-bestiary-and-enemies-book?_pos=10&_fid=532e29de0&_ss=c&variant=42661549375743), which is an actor compendium of enemies (a "Monster Manual") for the [Dungeon Fantary RPG](http://www.warehouse23.com/products/SJG31-1005#_ga=2.47807847.1171997671.1651678932-449078822.1651678932).

The Norðlond Óvinabókin requires the [GURPS 4th Edition Game Aid (Unofficial)](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gurps) Foundry system.

This is a premium product and requires a paid license to use in [Foundry](https://foundryvtt.com). You can acquire licenses here: [**TBD**] (Currently licenses are being distributed to Kickstarter backers, once that is complete we'll update the link with the Gaming Ballistic purchase page.)

## Using the Bestiary

After installation into your Foundry instance, you access the bestiary by selecting the "Compendiums" tab in the sidebar on the right of the Foundry window. There should be an "Actor" compendium entitled "Nordlond Bestiary and Enemies".

Click on that compendium and a window will open inside Foundry with an alphabetically sorted list of all the bestiary entries.

From this window you can search for a specific entry using the search bar, or click on an entry to open its Actor sheet inside Foundry.

When you see an entry you would like to use in a game session, open its Actor sheet and click the "Import" button in its title bar. This will add the entry to your Actors Directory in the sidebar.

Alternately, you can right click on the Compendium and select 'Import All Content' to import all 180+ enemies into your Actor directory.

At this point, the new Actor is ready to be used in a session.

## Overview of the Bestiary Actor Sheet

### Rollable Fields

Many of the fields on the actor sheet that could be rolled against in a game are clickable. Those fields are highlighted in gold when the mouse cursor hovers over them. In the example below, the mouse is hovering over the Augnarath's Strength (ST) score.

Clicking on these fields will make a standard GURPS 3d roll against that number, modified by any value in the modifier bucket.

### Modifiers

Some fields on the actor sheet will add bonuses or penalties to the modifier bucket. These are highlighted in orange. SM, or Size Modifier, is being hovered over.

### Editable Fields

Current HP, current FP, [Fantastic Dungeon Grappling](https://gaming-ballistic.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/fantastic-dungeon-grappling?_pos=5&_fid=532e29de0&_ss=c&variant=42552585322751) control points (CP), and Energy Reserve (if present) are editable. To change the currernt value, click into this field and replace its contents with the new current value.

### Attacks
Under the attributes is the Attacks section of the Actor sheet.

The name and level of the attack is rollable, as is the damage.

Modifiers like Acc and Bulk are also clickable and add their values to the modifier bucket.

### Skills and Spells

All skills and spells (if present) are rollable, as expected.

### Special Abilities and Notes

This section contains information that may be important in an encounter.

### Defenses

At the bottom of the Actor sheet, in a section that is always visible, are the various defense rolls typically made by this enemy. Parry, Dodge, and Block are clickable.

If one of those scores has an additional "+X" (+2, for example) to the right of the score, the actor has a Defensive Bonus (DB) equal to that value, typically from a shield. For defense rolls that qualify for the DB, click that field to make the corresponding defense roll with the DB modifier.

### Control Thresholds

This area tracks the current control threshold that applies to this actor, based on the current number of Control Points (CP) applied. This is a value from the [Fantastic Dungeon Grappling](https://gaming-ballistic.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/fantastic-dungeon-grappling?_pos=5&_fid=532e29de0&_ss=c&variant=42552585322751) rules and determines the DX penalty applied to the Actor.

### Image
The token image for this actor is visible in the upper-right corner of the Actor sheet. The "Share" button under that image opens the full image (typically with a silhouette for scale) of the bestiary actor that includes a "Show Players" button so that this image can be displayed to all the current players.

### Move Score
If an actor has more than one type of movement, there will be a dropdown below the Move score to select which move score to display.
